Dungeon Escape is a simple, turn-based dungeon crawler written in Java. The core loop is a linear progression through rooms, facing enemies, gaining experience, and looting weapons to become more powerful. There is no real-time movement or AI-driven behaviorâ€”combat is resolved via simple initiative rolls and damage calculations. The complexity of the game is focused on the choice of equipment, as there are a lot to choose from, and two hands to equip them.
